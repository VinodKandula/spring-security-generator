# spring-security-generator
This project was created as an experiment whether Spring Security could be better generated using a menu driven configuration, using the same idea as Spring Initializr

This project is used in two tutorials - 

1. Can Spring Security be auto-generated? (https://glenware.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/can-we-auto-generate-spring-security/ and https://dzone.com/articles/can-spring-security-benbspauto-generated)

2. Auto-generating Spring Security Tutorial â€“ Memory Realms (https://glenware.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/auto-generating-spring-security-tutorial-memory-realms/ and https://dzone.com/articles/auto-generating-spring-security-tutorial-memorynbs)

Features

* Memory Realms
* Default JDBC 
* LDAP
* Form Login and range of options

TaskList

I intend to add the following features - 

* Expand JDBC
* RememberMe
* Encryption
* Test coverage
* Other ideas? Mail Martin Farrell at contactus@glenware.com

Of course any help would be appreciated, or feedback
